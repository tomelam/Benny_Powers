1. To make module (package?) dependencies work, I removed the package-lock.json

1. When I get 'Found 260 vulnerabilities (2 low, 2 moderate, 256 high)
run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details', should I

it break things?

1. How can I use the components in the tutorial on my Apache2 server instead
of the npm server?
